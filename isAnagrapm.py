'''Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
'''

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s1 = ''.join(sorted(s))
        t1 = ''.join(sorted(t))
        return (s1 == t1)
